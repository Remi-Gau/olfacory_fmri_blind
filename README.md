## behavioral analysis

### quality control

`quality_control_beh` plots stimulation epochs, responses and respirations.

`quality_control_physio` plots the respiratory data from each subject / run and shows when the acquisition was started.

### results

`beh_avg_timeseries` plots the average across subjects of:
- stimulus onsets / offsets (to make sure that there is not too much variation between subjects)
- average across subject of the time course of each response type.
  - this can be row normalized for each subject (by the sum of response for that subject on that run - gives more weight to subjects with more SNR in their response)
  - it is possible to bin the responses from their original 25 Hz sampling frequency.
  - responses can be passed through a moving with window size

`beh_PSTH` plots data with PSTH for each stimulus (averaged across runs) and also plots the mean +/- SEM (and distribution) of the number of responses.


## fMRI analysis

For those you might need to edit the `set_dir` function to specify where the code is, the folder containing the BIDS raw data and the target directory where the SPM analysis should go.

### Copy and unzipping data
Type in the following command to copy the relevant files and unzip them:
`step_1_copy_and_unzip_files`


### Smoothing the data
Type in the following command to smooth the data them:
`step_2_smooth_func_files.m`


### Running the subject level GLM
Type in the following command to run the subject level GLM:
`step_3_run_first_level.m`
